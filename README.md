# Alt-Tab Active Windows

Alt-Tab Active Windows. Only show active(not minimized) windows on Alt-Tab.

Update: I have found this extension that makes the same thing - https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1437/current-screen-only-for-alternate-tab/ (https://github.com/mmai/Current_screen_only_on_window_switcher)
